To run the software:
 - mvn install
 - cd freq-tools/target
 - unzip freq-tools-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip
 - cd freq-tools-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/bin
 - open post-population-frequencies

 This multi-modual client requires both the freq-client and freq-tools folders to work. If you wish to move it, move the entire javaGui folder or the client will not have access to the API.
